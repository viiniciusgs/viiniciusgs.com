        Hey there! I&apos;m Vinicius Gabriel, I work as a Software Engineer and
        I&apos;m passionate about building appealing and interactive web
        experiences.

      <p className="mt-8">
        I was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I&apos;m 20 years old and I&apos;m
        currently studying System Analysis and Development at the FIAP. I got to
        know the world of programming in 2016 and since then I&apos;ve been
        getting deeper and deeper into the subject.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-8">
        One of my biggest passions is traveling, getting to know new places,
        customs and cultures from each location, when I&apos;m not working I
        like to watch series, read books, do workout, play video games and
        listen to music.
